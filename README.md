# Employee-Scheduler
Software allowing for the manager of a business to schedule shifts for their employees. Will also allow for employees to view the schedule assigned to them.
Welcome to our new scheduling interface!

As an admin you will have the ability to login and have access to special features.
In order to login as an Admin, look at the info.txt file
Here you will see a default see a default password and your email along with the decryption key that all the passwords are encrypted to. This is what prevents employees from seeing your password in th text file!
Underneath that you will see a bot email and bot email password, disregard this for now as your custom bot email is still under development
You will also see a dummy email and password for a test employee. You may use it if you want!
Make sure to write all the essential information (Your email, password, and decryption key) before deleteing the info.txt file so that no one can see your passwords
Once you login to the system you will see a schedule layout with a plus and minus button on the right
    Hit the plus button to add a shift for an employee
    Hit the mnus button to remove an employee from a shift

To add employees:
    Hit the create password button and enter in the desired password for an employee when prompted(Make sure to write it down)
    You will then be given the encrypted form to paste in a new line in passwords.txt file
    Make sure to also add the employee's email to the emails.txt file
    By doing this you will have created a new employee

Employee forgot password?
    If your employee forget their password they can hit the forgot password button
    A message will then appear in the message.txt file informing you that ine of your employees has forgotten their passwords
    You can then talk to your employees and if you do not have a copy of their password, make them a new account

If an employee logs in they will only see the schedule layout and will be unable to edit it.
Thank you for choosing our software!
